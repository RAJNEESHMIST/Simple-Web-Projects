# Weather Web App Readme

This readme file provides an overview and instructions for a Weather Web App created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview
The Weather Web App is a simple application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for a specific location. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data and display it to the user.

## Files and Directory Structure
The app consists of the following files:

1. `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the web app.
2. `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles and layout of the web app.
3. `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the functionality and interactions of the web app.
4. `README.md`: The readme file providing information and instructions.

## Getting Started
To run the Weather Web App on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository to your computer.
2. Open the project directory in a code editor of your choice.
3. In the `script.js` file, locate the variable `apiKey` and replace the placeholder with your own OpenWeatherMap API key. You can obtain an API key by signing up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
4. Save the changes to the `script1.js` file and style.css file.
5. Open the `index1.html` file in a web browser.
6. Start searching for weather by entering a location in the search input field and pressing the "Search" button.

## Usage
Once the Weather Web App is running in your web browser, you can perform the following actions:

- Enter the name of a city or location in the search input field.
- Press the "Search" button or hit the Enter key to retrieve the weather information for that location.
- The app will display the current temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the weather condition.
- If the location is found, the app will also display additional information such as humidity, wind speed, and visibility.
- If the location is not found or an error occurs, an appropriate message will be displayed to the user.

## Customization
You can customize the appearance and styles of the Weather Web App by modifying the `style.css` file. Feel free to make changes to suit your preferences and design requirements.

## Dependencies
The Weather Web App relies on the following dependencies:

- [OpenWeatherMap API](rapidapi.com): The app fetches weather data from this API.
-choose api as convenience to you.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The core technologies used to build the web app.
